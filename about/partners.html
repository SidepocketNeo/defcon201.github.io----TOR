computer groups, such as 2600, but rather to provide yet another gathering
place for the discussion of technology and security topics. DCG meetings are
open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc. DCGs
are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in
areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker
culture and it's members.
